<h1>Basics of Internet</h1>

  <pre style="font-family:inherit; white-space:pre-wrap;"><h2>Evolution of INTERNET:</h2><h3>1)Early Communication (pre-1950s):</h3>
Q)How did people communicate across long distance before electronic networks?

Ans:Early methods included letters, telegraphs, and later telephones. These methods were linear & required direct connection.

Q)What if communication lines were cut in a disruption?

The reliance on centralized systems made networks vulnerable.

Development:

Telegraph systems (mid-1800s) and telephone exchange (early 1900s) laid the groundwork for interconnected communication.

Cold War Era (1950s-1960s): The birth of ARPANET
<h3>2)Cold War US & Russia</h3>
Q)How could a country ensure communication continuity during nuclear attacks?

The Cold War raised fears of communication breakdown during an attack.

Q)Challenge: How can a network survive if some nodes are destroyed?

Existing communication systems relied on centralized systems.

Solution:

In 1961, Paul Baran proposed the concept of a packet-switched network, where data is broken into packets that travel independently and are reassembled at their destination.]

"ie phle msg completely jata tha â€”> ab man liya ki kise kann ye line break hogayi. ie ab apn msg bhej bhi nahi paaenge. Packet-Switched network ka generation kiya."


1969: ARPANET (Advance Research Projects Agency Network) was launched by the U.S. Department of Defence as the first decentralized network.
<h3>3)Expanding Beyond ARPANET (1970s): Interconnection</h3>
Q) Can different networks talk to each other?
Ans:ARPANET worked well, but it was isolated. Other networks (e.g., satellite and radio waves) emerged.

Challenge: How can diverse networks with different protocols communicate?

Each network used its unique set of rules (protocols), making communication between them impossible.

TCP/IP Protocol Suite (1974):

Some person developed Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which became the foundation for internet communication.

By 1983, TCP/IP was adopted as the standard for ARPANET.
<h3>4)Global Adoption (1980s): The Internet is Born</h3>
Q: How can the new grow to connect universities, companies, and individuals?

ARPANET was limited to U.S. government and academic institutions.

Challenge: How to scale the new while maintaining reliability?

Addressing and routing were key issues as the new expanded.

Solution:

DNS (Domain Name System) made it easier to find machines on the network with human-readable names (e.g., www.example.com
 instead of 127.0.0.1).

The concept of the World Wide Web (www) by Tim Berners-Lee introduced a system of linked hypertext documents.
